ZWave4j - java wrapper for OpenZWave (https://code.google.com/p/open-zwave) library.

The goal is to provide to java the same API as OpenZWave has.
Besides the wrapper ZWave4j has a simple executable 'Main' class which demonstrates how to work with ZWave4j.

ZWave4j supports *nix and Windows OS, x86 and amd64 architectures, GCC (MinGW for Windows) compiler.
It was tested on Windows 7 amd64, Windows XP x86 and Ubuntu 12.04 x86.
For Windows this build of MinGW was used: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds.

Requirements:

1. JDK 1.7+
2. Gradle 1.5+
3. GCC (MinGW for Windows)
4. OpenZWave

Preparations:

1. For Windows: patch OpenZWave sources with 'OpenZWave.patch', it has some fixes for MinGW build.
2. Compile OpenZWave.
3. Copy example.gradle.properties into gradle.properties.
4. Edit properties in gradle.properties:
    'openZWaveDir' - path to OpenZWave library source directory, needed for including headers.
    'openZWaveLibFile' - path to compiled OpenZWave library object file, needed for linking.
    'openZWaveConfigDir' - path to OpenZWave devices configurations directory, needed for OpenZWave library in runtime.
    'zWaveControllerPort' - path to serial device, which Z-Wave controller is connected to, e.g. '//./COM1' for Windows or '/dev/ttyUSB0' for Linux.

Build:

1. Run 'gradle jar' in console. It will compile native JNI library and java classes and put it into 'build/libs' and 'build/native-libs' directories.

Usage:

a. Run 'gradle run' in console. It will execute sample 'Main' class.
b. Run 'gradle install' to install library into local maven repository for using ZWave4j as a library in your other projects.
c. Execute ZWave4j 'Main' class manually from 'build/libs' directory:
java -Dzwave4j.nativeLibsDir="C:/zwave4j/build/native-libs" -Dzwave4j.openZWaveConfigDir="C:/open-zwave/config" -Dzwave4j.zWaveControllerPort="//./COM1" -cp zwave4j-0.1.jar org.zwave4j.Main
