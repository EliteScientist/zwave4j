zwave4j - java wrapper for OpenZwave (https://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/) library.
The goal is to provide to java the same API as OpenZwave has.
Besides the wrapper zwave4j has a simple executable Main class which is able to log notifications and switch all nodes on and off.

Requirements:

1. JDK 1.7+
2. Gradle 1.5+
3. GCC (MinGW for Windows)
4. OpenZwave (https://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/)

Build:

Build script is designed to be able to build under *nix and windows platforms with x86 and amd64 architectures.
It supports only GCC compiler (MinGW under Windows).
However, it was tested only on Windows 7 amd64 with 64-bit MinGW (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/).

1. Copy example.gradle.properties into gradle.properties.
2. Edit properties in gradle.properties:
    'openZwaveDir' - path to OpenZwave library source directory.
    'openZwaveLibFile' - path to compiled OpenZwave library object file.
3. Run 'gradle run' in console. It will compile native JNI library and java classes and run Main class.
4. Run 'gradle install' to install library into local maven repository for using zwave4j as a dependency in your other projects.
